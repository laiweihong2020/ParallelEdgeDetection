When running the program, make sure that the file has the following structure
submission
 |
 |-image_matrics
  |-results
   |-big
 |bigWorkList.txt
 |smallWordList.txt
 |par_canny.cpp

I have attached the image batch that I have used for some of my experiments. Just run it using the same slurm file that I have provided.

Note: I haven't had the time to sanitise the file addresses, so make sure that file structure above is followed.

If you want to add you own image, I have added imagePreprocessing.py to generate the txt images required by the program.
